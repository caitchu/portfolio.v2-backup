					<h2>FieldTrip</h2>
					<p class="opening-paragraph">Inspired by past experiences as an educator overseas, this app was designed as a digital solution for teachers to simplify the process of planning and booking educational field trips. It was initiated as an introductory UX/UI project at Brainstation's UX/UI design course (2016).</p>

					<h3>The Problem</h3>
					<p>Teachers in Ontario often use field trips to enrich the Ontario curriculum for students, but are limited by resources, selection and time, resulting in recycled field trips that lack effectiveness and learning value. Lengthy steps create delays while an overload of responsibilities give teachers little time to find the best trips fitting their classroom criteria without stress.</p>
					<h3>The Solution</h3>
					<p>Design a mobile application for teachers to explore field trip ideas relevant to their classroom needs and book them with ease.</p>

					<h3>User Research</h3>
					<p>After reaching out to several different teachers across public schools in Ontario for online and face-to-face interviews, these were the key findings:</p>

						<p>Teachers meet early in the year with prior research to agree on yearly budgets, plan field trips and proposals. Main steps are performed by the lead teacher.</p>

				<div class="columns-wrapper">
					<div class="column three-column-width">
						<img src="/images/persona_kyndra.png" alt="Kyndra's headshot, greyscale">
						<h4>Kyndra</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>28 years old</li>
							<li>Kindergarten Teacher</li>	
						</ul>	
						<p>"I want to explore different places I can take my kids before the school year begins and bookmark them for future reference."</p>
						<button id="expandKyndra" class="button-expand" onclick="showKyndra()">More details <i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i></button>

							<div class="extended-persona">
								<div class="close" onclick="showKyndra()">
									<i class="fas fa-window-close"></i>
								</div>
								<p>
									Before the school year begins, Kyndra wants to explore new trip ideas instead of repeating the same ones from last year. The first meeting with her fellow Kindergarten teachers will be her only chance to suggest new ideas appropriate for the grade, school budget and her class of 25 since the lead teacher often tries to keep the year minimal on meetings. Kyndra thus needs to have thorough research done beforehand.
								</p>
								<p>
									Kyndra also deals with an age group that is characterized by short attention spans, a broad mix of ESL backgrounds, and highly demanding parents who are prone to anxiety and protectiveness. There is extra pressure on her to ensure any fun, hands-on programs for her kids are 100% safe and risk-free. If her Kindergarteners grow bored, they generally become hyperactive and restless, which she would like to avoid.
								</p>
								<p>
									She really wishes there was an application that could allow her to thoroughly investigate programs in one place as well as bookmark programs for future reference, as she keeps track of her current options in a word document.

						<h4>Ivan</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>33 years old</li>
							<li>Gr. 8 Science Teacher</li>

								<div class="close" onclick="showIvan()">
									<i class="fas fa-window-close"></i>
								</div>						
								<p>
									Ivan is teaching a Grade 8 science class for the first time in his teaching career and really wants feedback from other experienced teachers on successful, engaging field trips he can take his class to supplement their curriculum. He teaches an age group in the inner city, who are characterized as rowdier and vocal. This makes him secretly nervous and emphasizes the importance of a program that keeps them busy and focused.
								</p>
								<p>
									His school is also located within a low-income demographic and he wants to find a place that will ideally be free or coverable by the school. Ivan is also juggling a very content-heavy curriculum plan and would like to save as much time as possible so he can focus on teaching and lesson planning. He dislikes having to remind the other teachers to hurry with the approval and booking process, as it was very awkward last year in the midst of a stressful period of the year.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ivan wishes there was a way to see what other teachers have successfully tried and to track where people have gone before, so he doesn't always have to rely on speaking to other teachers or Googling scarce reviews online.

								<div class="close" onclick="showAna()">
									<i class="fas fa-window-close"></i>
								</div>			
								<p>
									Ana is often short on time and needs to find a replacement trip for a tough bunch of fifth graders in the middle of the current school year. She has a child with ADHD in her over-sized class of 28, and two ESL immigrant students this year, which consumes more time than usual to accommodate. She also bears the responsibilities of being the lead teacher for Grade 5.
								</p>
								<p>
									She is a high-anxiety individual who needs to do as much as she can to reduce paperwork, emails and phone calls. She tries very hard to stay organized and have ample time to focus on her student's individual learning needs. The less time she spends on research, meetings, approvals and bookings, the better.
								</p>
								<p>
									She really wishes she could find something quickly, hasten the approval process and reduce the amount of time spent calling and emailing parties. She also juggles the responsibilities after work as a mother.

					<h3>Experience Map</h3>
					<p>The goal of the experience map was to understand how teachers currently handle finding and booking a field trip without a digital solution. It exposes where teachers lose time and efficiency, as well as what they are doing, thinking, and feeling at that specific time.</p>

					<p>Producing this map also drew attention to how users will need to issue proposals (aka approval requests) somehow through the app, and this will involve closing the app to wait for approvals from the appropriate parties. The user will then return to the app to proceed, an important aspect to the user flow.</p>

							<p>Quick rounds of sketches were conducted to get rough ideas of possible layouts and user flows. The ideas were discussed with my stand-up peers, and the best ones were flushed out.</p>

					<h3>Takeaways</h3>
					<p>A few of the things I'd like to change and continue implementing include:</p>
					<ul class="bullet-list">
						<li>Colours of the UI in order to fit the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</li>
						<li>A feature to enable ratings and reviews of each program</li>
						<li>UI adjustments that use the native elements of iOS for iOS instead of Android</li>
						<li>Further rounds of user testing</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Some of the highlighted lessons I learned from this project were:</p>
					<ul class="bullet-list">
						<li>The importance of a team for a project of this scale</li>
						<li>The value of thorough user research</li>
						<li>Using Feasibility vs. Value tests to reduce feature creep and determine the feasibility of what can be realistically achieved under the time constraints and resources</li>
						<li>Serve your user's main needs since the more features we have, the more difficult it is to maintain user-friendliness</li>
						<li>Everything should be less than three clicks away</li>
					</ul>
